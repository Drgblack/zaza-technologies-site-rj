              At Zaza Technologies, our mission is to revolutionize education by creating emotionally intelligent AI

              technology should amplify human connection, not replace it. Our platform empowers educators with insights
              and tools that help them better understand their students' emotional and academic needs, creating more
              inclusive, effective, and compassionate learning environments where every student can thrive.

              We envision a world where every classroom is equipped with emotionally intelligent technology that
              recognizes the unique needs of each learner. Our vision is to create a global educational ecosystem where
              AI serves as a compassionate companion to teachers, helping them identify when students need extra
              support, celebrating their successes, and fostering environments where emotional well-being and academic
              achievement go hand in hand. We see a future where technology bridges gaps rather than creating them,
              making quality education accessible and personalized for every student, everywhere.

                    Zaza Technologies was born not in a classroom, but in the quiet hours between corporate deadlines,
                    research papers, and the deep desire to build something that truly helps educators thrive.
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    Dr. Greg Blackburn spent two decades in Learning and Development, leading strategic education
                    initiatives across companies and universities. As a former tradesman turned academic with a PhD in
                    Professional Education, he knew the power of transformative learning. But over the years, he also
                    saw the growing emotional burden placed on teachers: the admin overload, the lack of time for
                    creativity, and the quiet burnout behind their dedication.

                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    Frustrated by generic tools that ignored both the emotional and pedagogical complexity of teaching,
                    Greg set out to build something better. Zaza was his answer: a suite of AI-powered tools grounded in
                    real educational research, designed not just to save time, but to support teachers as whole people,
                    both professionally and emotionally.

                    What began as a personal mission to restore joy and agency to educators has grown into a
                    teacher-first technology company helping thousands of teachers reclaim their time, reignite their
                    creativity, and reconnect with why they started teaching in the first place.
